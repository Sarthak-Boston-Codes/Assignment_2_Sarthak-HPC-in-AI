Q1)
My reaction is not convonced because when using tiled matrix multiplication on a GPU with 1024 thread blocks, each thread in each block calculates one element of the result matrix. For two 1024Ã—1024 matrices, we have 1,048,576 elements to compute. With 1024 threads per block on the G80 (which has a maximum of 512 threads per block actually), we will need at least 1024 blocks to cover all elements. But more importantly, each thread needs to perform 1024 multiply-accumulate operations for its element, not just one. The student seems to be confusing the parallelization of elements with the actual computation required per element.

Q2)
The kernel will work correctly only when BLOCK_SIZE evenly divides both A_width and A_height.
The problem in the question is that:

baseIdx += (blockIdx.y * BLOCK_SIZE + threadIdx.y) * A_width;

When BLOCK_SIZE doesn't evenly divide the matrix dimensions, the blocks at the edges will try to access memory beyond the matrix bounds. For example, if A_width is 100 and BLOCK_SIZE is 16, the last block in each row will have threads trying to access elements beyond column 100.

Q3)
To fix the code for all BLOCK_SIZE values:
Add boundary checking before accessing the arrays. Here's the fix:
cuda__global__ void 
BlockTranspose(float* A_elements, int A_width, int A_height) 
{
    __shared__ float blockA[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE];
    
    int baseIdx = blockIdx.x * BLOCK_SIZE + threadIdx.x;
    baseIdx += (blockIdx.y * BLOCK_SIZE + threadIdx.y) * A_width;
    
    if ((blockIdx.x * BLOCK_SIZE + threadIdx.x) < A_width && 
        (blockIdx.y * BLOCK_SIZE + threadIdx.y) < A_height) {
        blockA[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = A_elements[baseIdx];
    }
    
    __syncthreads();
    
    int writeCol = blockIdx.y * BLOCK_SIZE + threadIdx.x;
    int writeRow = blockIdx.x * BLOCK_SIZE + threadIdx.y;
    
    if (writeCol < A_height && writeRow < A_width) {
        A_elements[writeCol * A_width + writeRow] = blockA[threadIdx.x][threadIdx.y];
    }
}
The key changes are adding conditional checks before both reading from and writing to global memory to ensure we don't access out-of-bounds memory when the matrix dimensions aren't multiples of BLOCK_SIZE.
